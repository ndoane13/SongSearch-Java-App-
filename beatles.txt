TITLE="That Means A Lot"
LYRICS="A friend says that your love 
won't mean a lot 
And you know that your love 
is all you've got 
At times things are so fine 
and at times they're not 
But when she says she loves you, 
that means a lot 

A friend says that a love 
is never true 
And you know that this 
don't apply on you 
A touch can mean so much 
when it's all you've got 
When she says she loves you 
that means a lot 

Love can be deep inside, 
love can be suicide 
Can't you see you can't hide 
what you feel when it's real 

A friend says that your love 
won't mean a lot 
And you know that your love 
is all you've got 
A touch can mean so much 
when it's all you've got 
When she says she loves you 
that means a lot 

Can't you see, yeah 
Can't you see, yeah 
Can't you see, yeah 
Can't you see, yeah 
Can't you see, yeah 
Can't you see, yeah 
Can't you see, yeah 
Can't you see, yeah

TITLE="Little Girl Lies"
LYRICS="She loves you right now, so don't close your eyes
She'll be talking and laughing with six other guys
Flirtatious and cute, she'll take you the route
Telling Little Girl Lies
He loves her so much, he don't wanna lose her
And there's no other girl he likes to ball better
But he's busy tonight, ''We'll make it tomorrow''
He's telling his Little Girl Lies

That's how the Little Girl Lies
He's telling his Little Girl Lies
Those Little Girl Lies gonna catch up to you
And you'll be sorry!

Making excuses why she can't meet you later
She's not really ill, someone else got to date her
Mixed up and confused, it'll catch up to you
Telling Little Girl Lies

They tell the Little Girl Lies
He's telling his Little Girl Lies
That's how your Little Girl Lies
She's been telling you Little Girl Lies
That's how his Little Girl Lies
She been telling him Little Girl Lies
Those Little Girl Lies gonna catch up to you and you'll be sorry
Boo hoo

LYRICS="She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah 
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah 
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah 

You think you've lost your love 
Well, I saw her yesterday-yi-yay 
It's you she's thinking of 
And she told me what to say-yi-yay 

She says she loves you 
and you know that can't be bad 
Yes, she loves you 
and you know you should be glad 

She said you hurt her so 
She almost lost her mind 
And now she says she knows 
You're not the hurting kind 

She says she loves you 
and you know that can't be bad 
Yes, she loves you 
and you know you should be glad 

Oo, she loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah 
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah 
And with a love like that 
You know you should be glad 

You know it's up to you 
I think it's only fair 
Pride can hurt you too 
Apologize to her 

Because she loves you 
and you know that can't be bad 
Yes, she loves you 
and you know you should be glad 

Oo, she loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah 
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah 
And with a love like that 
You know you should be glad 
And with a love like that

TITLE="Modern Woman"
LYRICS="You see her sitting with her coffee and her paper
With her high top sneakers of italian design
With a long cool stare she aggravates the tension
Makes up her face while she makes up her mind

Now you're in trouble, maybe she's an intellectual
What if she figures out you're not very smart
Or maybe she's the quiet type who's into heavy metal
Boy, you got to get it settled
Cause she's breaking your heart

Don't try to put on an act
You can't do that to a modern woman
And you're an old fashioned man
She understands the things you're doin'
She's a modern woman

She looks sleek and she seems so professional
She's got a lot of confidence, it's easy to see
You want to make a move
But you feel so inferior
Cause under that exterior
Is someone who's free

She's got style and she's got her own money
So she's not another honey you can quickly disarm
She's got the eyes that make you realize
She won't be hypnotized by your usual charm

You've got your plan of attack
That won't attract the modern woman
Whe you're an old fashioned man
She understands the things you're doin'
She's a modern woman

Time goes by and you're sharing an apartment
She says she loves you but she doesn't know why
In the morning she leaves you with your coffee and your paper
It's a strange situation for an old fashioned guy

But times have changed
Things are not the same, baby
You overcame such a bad attitude
Rock and roll just used to be for kicks
And nowadays it's politics
And after 1986 what else could be new

You got to learn to relax
And face the facts of modern woman
And you're an old fashioned man
She understands the things you're doin'
She's a modern woman
